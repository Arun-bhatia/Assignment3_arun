An Announcement was posted 
in "The Viking Village Newspaper", later that week:

The Familes of Astridle Guðmundsdóttir and Hugi Ólafur
are Happy to announce the Marriage of their Children.

The Ceremony will take place on the third Sunnudagur of Góa 
at the Temple of Frigga in Alst.

All are Welcome.
